### Reflection (STAR)

**S – Situation:**
I was privileged to attend a CV and interview preparation workshop in the Work Readiness Programme hosted by the Jobbox as I waws selected to be part of the internship programme.

**T – Task:**
My goal was to learn how to improve my CV and prepare for interviews within the ICT industry.

**A – Action:**
During the workshop, I had close observations on how to prepare a professional CV, highlight my technical and soft skills, and tailor it for specific job openings. I also had mock interview sessions and asked about common interview mistakes.

**R – Result:**
I learned how to deal with employers in a more professional way. I revised my CV based on the feedback received during the workshop and now have the confidence to go for interviews and talk about my strengths and experiences.

## Skills and Interests

###  Reflection (STAR)

**S – Situation:**
As part of my self-improvement and technical skills development as an ICT practitioner, I enrolled in an online course from Cisco Networking Academy entitled "JavaScript Essentials." I did this because I am highly interested in web development, and I needed to reinforce my programming skills with a widely used scripting language.

**T – Task:**
The course required me to grasp the fundamentals of JavaScript programming, including variables, loops, functions, if/else statements, and dealing with objects and arrays. Passing the course and earning the certificate was not my sole objective but getting hands-on skills that I could apply to real projects, especially front-end web applications.

**A – Action:**
I set aside quality time each week to study the modules. I coded through interactive coding challenges and hands-on labs provided by the Cisco platform. I took profuse notes and executed my code in a local development environment to experiment with things beyond the problems. Wherever I came across difficult subjects—e.g., JavaScript scope or async code—I used Cisco's discussion forums, external tutorials like MDN Web Docs, and video tutorial guides on YouTube to reinforce learning. I also read every module thoroughly before taking the final test.

**R – Result:**
By the end of the course, I was successful in achieving the Cisco JavaScript Essentials certification. Above all, I developed confidence in simple script writing, DOM manipulation, and fundamental concepts of programming. The course not only reaffirmed my interest in web development but also motivated me to pursue more advanced subjects in JavaScript, like application of React frameworks. Through the experience, I also learned good study habits and the need for continuous learning in the field of technology.

## Personality Assessment

### Reflection (STAR)

**S – Situation:**  
As part of the Work Readiness Programme, I completed a personality test designed to help individuals learn about their behavior, strengths, and areas for development. I used an online tool that determined my personality type to be a "Commander" (ENTJ) and highlighted that I am highly extraverted. This sort is distinguished by leadership potential, organizational strategizing, and a solid goal-realization orientation. I needed to know how my results would inform me about my vocational interests, teamwork, and workplace communication style.

**T – Task:**
My task was to examine the results and reflect on the impact of the specified traits on my personal development and readiness to work. Specifically, I wished to know how my prevailing traits — such as assertiveness, confidence, logical decision-making, and extraversion — influence my interaction with others, leadership in groups, and leading or following when working on projects. I also wanted to know in which areas I need to change or be more conscious, i.e., being overly critical or taking charge too quickly and not allowing others to contribute their ideas.

**A – Action:**
I read through the personality type explanation in depth and took notes on characteristics such as my desire for structure, efficiency, and strategic long-term planning. I reflected on experiences from group projects and leadership roles, where I had taken charge of task organization, delegating responsibility, and guiding the group towards a common objective. For example, in a recent university project, I naturally fell into a leadership role, creating a timeline, assigning deliverables, and keeping the team on track. I also drew on feedback I've received from colleagues, where I was sometimes encouraged to stop and allow others more space to share ideas. To grow in this competency, I began to practice more active listening and involving team members in decision-making.

**R – Result:**
The test helped me confirm that leadership and communication are my strengths, and that I am good at roles in which I inspire others and have responsibility. It also helped me understand the importance of emotional intelligence — being sensitive to how others feel and adjusting my style to suit. With this self-knowledge, I now feel better equipped to sell myself in interviews and group environments, not only my leadership skills but also my passion for working with and learning from others. Going forward, I will be looking for career roles in project management, systems analysis, or team-based ICT environments where my strategic mind and outgoing personality can add value. The assessment has been an excellent tool for career insight and personal growth, and I now have specific traits that I can cite in an interview to demonstrate my strengths and development process.
