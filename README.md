### Reflection (STAR)

**S – Situation:**
I was privileged to attend a CV and interview preparation workshop in the Work Readiness Programme hosted by the Jobbox as I waws selected to be part of the internship programme.

**T – Task:**
My goal was to learn how to improve my CV and prepare for interviews within the ICT industry.

**A – Action:**
During the workshop, I had close observations on how to prepare a professional CV, highlight my technical and soft skills, and tailor it for specific job openings. I also had mock interview sessions and asked about common interview mistakes.

**R – Result:**
I learned how to deal with employers in a more professional way. I revised my CV based on the feedback received during the workshop and now have the confidence to go for interviews and talk about my strengths and experiences.
