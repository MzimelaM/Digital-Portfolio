## Skills and Interests

###  Reflection (STAR)

**S ‚Äì Situation:**
As part of my self-improvement and technical skills development as an ICT practitioner, I enrolled in an online course from Cisco Networking Academy entitled "JavaScript Essentials." I did this because I am highly interested in web development, and I needed to reinforce my programming skills with a widely used scripting language.

**T ‚Äì Task:**
The course required me to grasp the fundamentals of JavaScript programming, including variables, loops, functions, if/else statements, and dealing with objects and arrays. Passing the course and earning the certificate was not my sole objective but getting hands-on skills that I could apply to real projects, especially front-end web applications.

**A ‚Äì Action:**
I set aside quality time each week to study the modules. I coded through interactive coding challenges and hands-on labs provided by the Cisco platform. I took profuse notes and executed my code in a local development environment to experiment with things beyond the problems. Wherever I came across difficult subjects‚Äîe.g., JavaScript scope or async code‚ÄîI used Cisco's discussion forums, external tutorials like MDN Web Docs, and video tutorial guides on YouTube to reinforce learning. I also read every module thoroughly before taking the final test.

**R ‚Äì Result:**
By the end of the course, I was successful in achieving the Cisco JavaScript Essentials certification. Above all, I developed confidence in simple script writing, DOM manipulation, and fundamental concepts of programming. The course not only reaffirmed my interest in web development but also motivated me to pursue more advanced subjects in JavaScript, like application of React frameworks. Through the experience, I also learned good study habits and the need for continuous learning in the field of technology.

## Personality Assessment

### Reflection (STAR)

**S ‚Äì Situation:**  
As part of the Work Readiness Programme, I completed a personality test designed to help individuals learn about their behavior, strengths, and areas for development. I used an online tool that determined my personality type to be a "Commander" (ENTJ) and highlighted that I am highly extraverted. This sort is distinguished by leadership potential, organizational strategizing, and a solid goal-realization orientation. I needed to know how my results would inform me about my vocational interests, teamwork, and workplace communication style.

**T ‚Äì Task:**
My task was to examine the results and reflect on the impact of the specified traits on my personal development and readiness to work. Specifically, I wished to know how my prevailing traits ‚Äî such as assertiveness, confidence, logical decision-making, and extraversion ‚Äî influence my interaction with others, leadership in groups, and leading or following when working on projects. I also wanted to know in which areas I need to change or be more conscious, i.e., being overly critical or taking charge too quickly and not allowing others to contribute their ideas.

**A ‚Äì Action:**
I read through the personality type explanation in depth and took notes on characteristics such as my desire for structure, efficiency, and strategic long-term planning. I reflected on experiences from group projects and leadership roles, where I had taken charge of task organization, delegating responsibility, and guiding the group towards a common objective. For example, in a recent university project, I naturally fell into a leadership role, creating a timeline, assigning deliverables, and keeping the team on track. I also drew on feedback I've received from colleagues, where I was sometimes encouraged to stop and allow others more space to share ideas. To grow in this competency, I began to practice more active listening and involving team members in decision-making.

**R ‚Äì Result:**
The test helped me confirm that leadership and communication are my strengths, and that I am good at roles in which I inspire others and have responsibility. It also helped me understand the importance of emotional intelligence ‚Äî being sensitive to how others feel and adjusting my style to suit. With this self-knowledge, I now feel better equipped to sell myself in interviews and group environments, not only my leadership skills but also my passion for working with and learning from others. Going forward, I will be looking for career roles in project management, systems analysis, or team-based ICT environments where my strategic mind and outgoing personality can add value. The assessment has been an excellent tool for career insight and personal growth, and I now have specific traits that I can cite in an interview to demonstrate my strengths and development process.

### Reflection (STAR)

**S ‚Äì Situation:**
In preparation for future employment and internship opportunities, I needed to create a professional CV that clearly articulates my qualifications, technical abilities, and career goals as a third-year ICT student with a major in Applications Development. I was well aware of how possessing a well-prepared CV would assist me in making a good impression and highlighting my potential employers in a highly competitive job market.

**T ‚Äì Task:**
My task was to design and write a comprehensive CV that would be able to present my academic background, hands-on experience, volunteering, and personal projects. The CV was supposed to be brief, clear, and aligned with tech industry standards. I aimed at not only completing the academic requirement but also having the CV ready for actual employment purposes, particularly for internships or junior programmers for software development and web/mobile app design.

**A ‚Äì Action:**
To start, I referred to CV writing best practice like CPUT career guidance recommendations, LinkedIn Learning samples, and industry blogs. I chose a clean layout with emphasis on readability and tone of professionalism. I included my full name, contact details, and bold career objective that indicates my interest in software engineering and willingness to grow in challenging, real-world environments.

For the **Education** section, I added my currently undergoing diploma at CPUT and Port Shepstone High School matric certificate. I also went the extra step in the **Technical Skills** section, ensuring that I categorized my proficiency with programming languages Java, Python, and Dart, and frameworks and tools Flutter and Firebase, proof of my interest in creating mobile apps.

I also included **Soft Skills** like problem-solving, communication, and teamwork to show that I am not just technically capable but can also excel in team-based situations.

Under the **Work Experience** category, despite lacking formal work, I included my volunteer position as a cashier at Thengeduze Liquor Store. This demonstrated that I am proactive and experienced in administration and inventory handling. It also served to prove soft skills such as attention to detail, dependability, and exposure to general business operations.

The **Projects** section was most exciting for me. I included group projects such as the **QR Code Attendance System**, which I coded with Flutter and Firebase. The project showcases my practical experience with real-time authentication and user interface design. I included the **E-commerce Art Website** project also, where I offered front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects allowed me to showcase my collaborative abilities, creativity, and technical problem-solving in real development environments.

Finally, I added an **Additional Information** section where I stated that I would be keen to be available for junior roles or internships, and I was interested in web and mobile development. I made sure the CV was professionally laid out, aesthetically pleasing, and error-free before saving it in PDF format. 

**R ‚Äì Result:**
The final version of my CV demonstrates both my academic accomplishment and the experiential learning that I've gained through course work and projects. It clearly defines a vision of who I am as a developing professional ‚Äî excited about software programming, committed to continuous learning, and willing to add value to working groups. Through this exercise, I felt more assured about how to sell myself to potential employers. I now have a CV that is job-ready and can be used for internships, graduate schemes, or applying for jobs, and the skill to keep it current as I develop my career. This exercise made me realize that creating a CV is not simply an administrative process, but a personal branding tool that makes me stop and think about my path, achievements, and direction.
