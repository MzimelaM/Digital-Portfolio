### Reflection (STAR)

**S – Situation:**
I was privileged to attend a CV and interview preparation workshop in the Work Readiness Programme hosted by the Jobbox as I waws selected to be part of the internship programme.

**T – Task:**
My goal was to learn how to improve my CV and prepare for interviews within the ICT industry.

**A – Action:**
During the workshop, I had close observations on how to prepare a professional CV, highlight my technical and soft skills, and tailor it for specific job openings. I also had mock interview sessions and asked about common interview mistakes.

**R – Result:**
I learned how to deal with employers in a more professional way. I revised my CV based on the feedback received during the workshop and now have the confidence to go for interviews and talk about my strengths and experiences.

##Skills and Interests

###  Reflection (STAR)

**S – Situation:**
As part of my self-improvement and technical skills development as an ICT practitioner, I enrolled in an online course from Cisco Networking Academy entitled "JavaScript Essentials." I did this because I am highly interested in web development, and I needed to reinforce my programming skills with a widely used scripting language.

**T – Task:**
The course required me to grasp the fundamentals of JavaScript programming, including variables, loops, functions, if/else statements, and dealing with objects and arrays. Passing the course and earning the certificate was not my sole objective but getting hands-on skills that I could apply to real projects, especially front-end web applications.

**A – Action:**
I set aside quality time each week to study the modules. I coded through interactive coding challenges and hands-on labs provided by the Cisco platform. I took profuse notes and executed my code in a local development environment to experiment with things beyond the problems. Wherever I came across difficult subjects—e.g., JavaScript scope or async code—I used Cisco's discussion forums, external tutorials like MDN Web Docs, and video tutorial guides on YouTube to reinforce learning. I also read every module thoroughly before taking the final test.

**R – Result:**
By the end of the course, I was successful in achieving the Cisco JavaScript Essentials certification. Above all, I developed confidence in simple script writing, DOM manipulation, and fundamental concepts of programming. The course not only reaffirmed my interest in web development but also motivated me to pursue more advanced subjects in JavaScript, like application of React frameworks. Through the experience, I also learned good study habits and the need for continuous learning in the field of technology.
